# Computational Economics with Python

## Graduate Mini Course at Columbia University


* Instructor: John Stachurski
* Dates: 26--28th March 2018
* Times: 9--12 each morning
* Location: TBA


### Summary

This mini course will provide a (very) fast paced introduction to Python for
computational economic modeling aimed at graduate students, from foundations
to high performance computing.  We will cover

* The Python language: syntax and semantics
* Object oriented vs procedural programming
* [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
* The major scientific libraries ([SciPy]((http://www.scipy.org/) / NumPy / [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) / etc)
* [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) and other JIT compilers
* Parallelization
* Distributed and cloud computing
* Applications from economic dynamics (e.g., asset pricing, optimal stopping)
