# Computational Economics with Python

## Graduate Mini Course at Columbia University


* Instructor: John Stachurski
* Dates: 26--28th March 2018
* Times: 9--12 each morning
* Location: TBA


### Summary

This mini course will provide a fast paced introduction to Python for
computational economic modeling, from basic scripting to high performance
computing.  The course is aimed at graduate students with proficiency in at
least one scientific computing platform (e.g, MATLAB, Fortran, STATA, R, C or
Julia).

Topics:

* Python vs MATLAB vs Julia vs Fortran vs others
* The Python language: syntax and semantics
* Object oriented vs procedural programming
* [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
* The major scientific libraries ( [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) / NumPy / [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) / etc.)
* [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) and other JIT compilers
* Parallelization
* Distributed and cloud computing
* Applications from economic dynamics (e.g., asset pricing, optimal stopping)


No Python knowledge is assumed.
